# EX 5A Minimum Cost Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Python program using A Naive recursive implementation of Minimum Cost Path Problem.

## Algorithm
1.Start by reading the number of rows R and columns C from the user.
2. Define a recursive function minCost(cost, m, n) that computes the minimum cost to reach cell (m, n) from (0, 0).
3. Check base conditions:
    If m < 0 or n < 0, return a very large number (infinity-like) to avoid invalid paths.
    If m == 0 and n == 0, return the cost at (0, 0) as it's the starting point.

4.Recursively calculate the minimum of the three possible directions (diagonal, up, left) and add the current cellâ€™s cost.   
5. Print the minimum cost to reach cell (R-1, C-1) using the recursive function.  

## Program:

```python
R = int(input())
C = int(input())
import sys
def minCost(cost, m, n):
    if (n < 0 or m < 0):
        return sys.maxsize
    elif (m == 0 and n == 0):
        return cost[m][n]
    else:
        return cost[m][n] + min( minCost(cost, m-1, n-1),
                                minCost(cost, m-1, n),
                                minCost(cost, m, n-1) )
def min(x, y, z):
    if (x < y):
        return x if (x < z) else z
    else:
        return y if (y < z) else z
cost= [ [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 8, 2],
        [1, 5, 3] ]
print(minCost(cost, R-1, C-1))
```

## Result:
Thus the above program was executed successfully for finding the minimum cost.
